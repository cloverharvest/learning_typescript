###This is the Getting Started documentation for TypeScript   
   1) Use documentation from typescriptlang.org. It's easy to follow and has very good documentation.   
   2) This uses the atom as the code editor. If you are an NPM user, run on the terminal, ```npm install -g typescript```   3) To compile Typescript into JavaScript, run on the terminal, ``` tsc filename.ext ```   
   4) Make a filename.html file and call the js file inline on the script tag, as if you were calling it as an external js file   
   5) Doubleclick on that html file in your Finder and it will display your first-ever Typescript file.   
   6) That's the start for npm-loving, atom-loving, js-loving coders as we venture into Typescript.   
   7) Fun!   
   8) Now to go deeper and meld it with Angular2.
